IntelliJ Platform runs on JVM, so this can seem like a huge limitation, but don't worry. Kotlin looks a lot like TypeScript. Bigger issue is scarce documentation for their API. I'll write a few words describing it some day.

For now, please report what could be improved. IntelliJ has a huge feature set, I personally don't use everything it has to offer.
